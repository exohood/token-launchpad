# Create and Issue your own Token ü™ô

Choose between the Ethereum, Base, Solana, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Polygon, Binance. Blast or Exohood to create and deploy your smart contract for a project, company, artwork, music, asset, or game. No programming knowledge is required simply follow the instructions below.

# Token Instructions ‚ö†Ô∏è

How to create and deploy a smart contract on Ethereum, Base, Solana, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Polygon, Binance. Blast or Exohood using the Exohood Token Launchpad:


1. Choose your token offering package and make the payment.

‚Ä¢	Payments must be made on the same network as your chosen token. For example, if you select an Ethereum token, payment should be made using USDT on the Ethereum network.

2. Create your smart contract:

a. Token name: Choose a name for your project or company. The name should be 5-25 characters long and can include both uppercase and lowercase letters (no spaces).

b. Token owner address: This should be the same address used to make the payment.

c. Token symbol: Use 3-4 unique letters (e.g., ETH, BTC, EXO). Ensure the symbol is not already in use before deploying the contract.

d. Decimals: Set the number of decimals for your token (e.g., 0-50). The standard is 18 decimals.

e. Token supply: Specify the total quantity to mint. You can allocate tokens for the team, rewards, or investors.

f. Token allocation address: Provide the address where your tokens will be supplied.


# Deploy your Contract üöÄ


Tipsüí°:

a. Scan Verification: We provide source code verification to ensure transparency for users interacting with your smart contract.

b. White Labeling: Contracts are deployed from a neutral address, with no reference to the Exohood Deployer.

c. Contract Deployment: Once submitted, your contract will be sent to our deployment platform for validation. This process typically takes 3-5 hours.

d. Token Allocation Address: Use a different address from your token owner address (e.g., create another address in MetaMask or Trust Wallet).

# Disclaimer

Exohood assumes no responsibility concerning the token creation, the token owner is responsible for the security, accuracy, sales or use of third party.
